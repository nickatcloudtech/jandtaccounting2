      "title": "How do I avoid penalties and interest on my income taxes?",
      "content": "Very simply…. pay all tax payments (including estimates) on time by the due date. Your total withholding or estimated tax must be either 100% of the prior years tax bill or 90% of your current tax bill. *For example, if your total federal tax liability on your 2023 return was $5,000, and your total tax liability in 2024 is $6,000, your 2024 withholding (or estimates paid) to avoid penalty must be $5,000. If your 2024 total tax liability is $4,500, then your minimum withholding would be $4,050. Anytime you owe more than $1,000 when you file, you can be subject to penalties unless these criteria are met.",

      "title": "Why do I owe penalties and interest on my tax bill, or get additional bills in the mail after I file?",
      "content": "This is a two-part question and our most common: Taxes are due when income is RECEIVED!! This is why taxes are always taken out of your paycheck on a regular basis. If you do not have taxes taken out…. Such as from self-employment or investments, then you must make quarterly estimated payments throughout the year. If you do NOT make proper estimated payments, the IRS and state tax agencies have the full legal right to access penalties for not doing so. Interest accrues when payments are not made by the due date (not including extensions). This includes payment dates for estimated quarterly payments as well.",
